#### ðŸŒŸ A Collaborative Community Engagement Platform ðŸŒŸ

This innovative platform is here to empower community members to actively engage with local decision-makers and drive positive change. With this platform, they'll have a dedicated space to voice their concerns, share ideas, and collaborate with others who are passionate about making a difference. Whether it's addressing traffic congestion, improving local infrastructure, or tackling environmental issues, community members can come together to ensure their voices are heard and their issues are resolved. Plus, with active involvement from the council, effective resolution can be ensured every step of the way.

### Reason for this project?
The aim is to establish a platform where community members can openly engage in constructive dialogue to address and resolve the challenges they encounter within their communities.

Expanding on the previous project, I wanted to focus on user authentication using vanilla JavaScript. I also wanted to add more pages and complexity to enhance the overall experience.

### Future features:

A Reports page: This feature will enable council members to close issues raised by the community. Council members will have to clearly state resolutions to the issue being closed or state alternative options. Once closed, issues will be archived on a dedicated page for community reference and transparency.

## Frontend
url: https://nexusolve-client.onrender.com

I've developed responsive designs using pure CSS to cater to three distinct screen sizes: large monitors, medium-sized laptops, and large mobile devices. The application comprises the following pages:
  - Landing page
  - Registration page
  - Login page
  - Dashboard
  - Account page
  - About pages

Each page is optimised to adapt seamlessly across the designated screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for users accessing the application from different devices.
